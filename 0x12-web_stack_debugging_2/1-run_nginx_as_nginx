#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Module: configure_nginx
# 
# This script performs the following tasks to configure Nginx on a web server:
# 1. Updates the Nginx configuration to run as the 'nginx' user instead of 'www-data'.
# 2. Changes the port that Nginx listens on from 80 to 8080.
# 3. Sets appropriate file permissions for the Nginx configuration file.
# 4. Terminates any running Apache2 processes to avoid conflicts.
# 5. Starts the Nginx service as the 'nginx' user.
# 
# Usage:
#   ./configure_nginx.sh
# 
# Script Breakdown:
# 
# 1. **Update Nginx Configuration to Run as nginx User**:
#    - `sed -i "s/#user www-data/user nginx/" /etc/nginx/nginx.conf`
#    - This command updates the Nginx configuration file to run as the 'nginx' user by
#      replacing the 'www-data' user directive. The '#' character is removed from the
#      beginning of the line to uncomment the 'user nginx;' directive.
# 
# 2. **Change Nginx Listening Port to 8080**:
#    - `sed -i "s/80/8080/g" /etc/nginx/sites-available/default`
#    - This command updates the port number in the default Nginx site configuration file
#      from 80 to 8080 for all occurrences.
# 
# 3. **Set File Permissions for Nginx Configuration File**:
#    - `chmod 644 /etc/nginx/nginx.conf`
#    - This command sets the permissions of the Nginx configuration file to be readable
#      and writable by the owner, and readable by everyone else.
# 
# 4. **Terminate Apache2 Processes**:
#    - `pkill apache2`
#    - This command stops all running Apache2 processes to ensure there are no conflicts
#      with Nginx.
# 
# 5. **Start Nginx Service as nginx User**:
#    - `sudo -u nginx service nginx start`
#    - This command starts the Nginx service using the 'nginx' user to ensure that it
#      runs with the correct permissions.
# 
# Prerequisites:
# - The script should be executed with root or sudo privileges to modify system files,
#   terminate processes, and start services.
# 
# Arguments:
#   None
# 
# Returns:
#   void
