## About

The ALX System Engineering & DevOps curriculum is designed to provide hands-on experience with system administration, server management, web infrastructure, and DevOps practices. Students learn to work with Linux systems, configure web servers, manage databases, implement load balancing, and automate deployment processes.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this curriculum, students will be able to:

- Navigate and manage Linux/Unix systems effectively
- Configure and manage web servers (Nginx, Apache)
- Implement load balancing and high availability solutions
- Work with databases and manage data persistence
- Use configuration management tools (Puppet, Ansible)
- Implement monitoring and logging solutions
- Understand networking concepts and protocols
- Practice Infrastructure as Code (IaC) principles
- Implement CI/CD pipelines
- Manage containerized applications with Docker
- Deploy applications to cloud platforms

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of computer systems
- Familiarity with command line interfaces
- Basic programming knowledge (preferably Python or Bash)
- Understanding of web technologies (HTTP, HTML, CSS)

   # Using Vagrant (optional)
   vagrant init ubuntu/focal64
   vagrant up
   vagrant ssh
   ```

2. **Update System**
   ```bash
   sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
   ```
